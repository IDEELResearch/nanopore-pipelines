# Alignment scripts

- This directory contains snakemake templates to run on the cluster
  - Also contains an example script of submitting the snakemake.py file to the cluster using SLURM
- Scripts for aligning demultiplexed reads with minimap2 (probably what you want) or ngmlr (a nice alternative aligner which you may want to consider if looking for structural variants)
